** Make =alfy=
The program =alfy= depends on the divsufsort library. On Debian-like
system we can install it with
#+begin_src sh 
sudo apt install libdivsufsort-dev
#+end_src
On macOS we can use
#+begin_src sh 
brew install libdivsufsort
#+end_src
Then we can run
#+begin_src sh 
make
#+end_src
to make the executable =alfy= in the directory =bin=.

** Test =alfy=
The command
#+begin_src sh
make test
#+end_src
downloads the test data into the directory =data= and tests =alfy=.

** Get Tutorial Data
The data used in the tutorial is the same as the data used for
testing. It can be downloaded separately by running
#+begin_src sh
  make data
#+end_src
which generates the directory =data= containing the data files.
