** Make =alfy= on Debian-like Systems
Install the developer version of the =divsufsort= library
#+begin_src sh
  sudo apt install libdivsufsort-dev
#+end_src
Run
#+begin_src sh 
make
#+end_src
to make the executable =alfy= in the directory =bin=.

** Make =alfy= on macOS
Install the =divsufsort= library from source as explained in its
[[https://github.com/y-256/libdivsufsort][repository]]. Then run
#+begin_src sh 
make mac
#+end_src
to make the executable =alfy= in the directory =bin=.

** Test =alfy=
Run
#+begin_src sh
make test
#+end_src
to download the test data into the directory =data= and test =alfy=.

** Get Tutorial Data
The data used in the tutorial is the same as the data used for
testing. It can be downloaded separately by running
#+begin_src sh
  make data
#+end_src
which generates the directory =data= containing the data files.
