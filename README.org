** Make and Use program
Run
#+begin_src sh 
make
#+end_src

This command builds the libraries and two executables: =alfy= and =alfy64=.
=alfy= is a 32-bit program and =alfy64= is a 64-bit program. In general, 
=alfy64= is used for large-scale data sets containing more than 5 x 10^8 bp, 
and =alfy= for smaller data sets.

If you would like to use =alfy= or =alfy64= from any directory,
include the path to these executables in you =PATH= variable, e.g:

#+begin_src sh
PATH=${PATH}:$(HOME)/some-path/Alfy_XXX
#+end_src
or copy the executables to your =bin= directory.

To get the example data used in the tutorial, run
#+begin_src sh
  make data
#+end_src
which generates the directory =data= containing the data files.
