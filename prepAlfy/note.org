* Note on prepAlfy

At the moment we have the structure

for query in queries; do
   for subject in subjects; do
      calculate esa of subject
      scan query
   done
done

This means that for every query we repeat the calculation of all
esas. To avoid this, we could pre-calculate the esas to get

for subject in subjects; do
   calculate esa e of subject
   append e to esas
done

for query in queries; do
   for esa in esas; do
      scan query
   done
done
